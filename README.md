Auditory [Lexical Decision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_decision_task) Experiment with Auditory Prime (template)

# Generic documentation
Please read the [generic documentation](https://github.com/UiL-OTS-labs/jspsych-uil-template-docs) for some context and scope.

# Task Description
One of the variations of an Auditory Lexical Decision task. In this variation, a trial consists of two connected auditory 'test items', one is an auditory _prime_ word (or non-word), the other a second word (or non-word). The words are presented as a pair. After the second word, the participant is asked to respond --as soon as possible -- with keyboard keys and indicate wether _both_ heard words are real words or not.  

## Short description
# Output

The data of _all_ (sub) _trial phases_ are logged in the data, but the output data can be filtered after data collection in many ways.
Please read the [general primer on jsPsych's data](https://github.com/UiL-OTS-labs/jspsych-output) if you are new to jsPsych data output.

Essential output for the _'true experimental'_ purpose in this template are:

- Reaction Time (RT) of the keyboard response in the decision phase
- Correctness of the keyboard response in the decision phase

The crucial trial/sub-trial phase (decision phase) output may look similar to this:
