Auditory [Lexical Decision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_decision_task) Experiment with Auditory Prime (template)

# Generic documentation
Please read the [generic documentation](https://github.com/UiL-OTS-labs/jspsych-uil-template-docs) for some context and scope.

# Task Description
One of the variations of an Auditory Lexical Decision task. In this variation, a trial consists of two connected auditory 'test items', one is an auditory _prime_ word (or non-word), the other a second word (or non-word). The words are presented as a pair. After the second word, the participant is asked to respond --as soon as possible -- with keyboard keys and indicate wether _both_ heard words are real words or not.

Crucial trial phases (sub trial phases):
- Fixation cross
- Auditory prime
- Auditory decision (decision phase)

# Output
The data of _all_ (sub) _trial phases_ are logged in the data, but the output data can be filtered after data collection in many ways.
Please read the [general primer on jsPsych's data](https://github.com/UiL-OTS-labs/jspsych-output) if you are new to jsPsych data output.

Essential output variables are:

- Reaction Time (RT) of the keyboard response in the decision phase
- Correctness of the keyboard response in the decision phase

The crucial trial/sub-trial phase (decision phase) output may look similar to this:

# Getting started 
People _affiliated with our lab_ can use the information [from our lab webiste](https://uilots-labs.wp.hum.uu.nl/experiments/overview/) and expand the "Online experiments using jsPsych" section for details. Please follow [this how-to](https://uilots-labs.wp.hum.uu.nl/how-to/online-experimenting/).

### Make your experiment ready for use with the data server

### Update access key
In the file `globals.js` is a variable:
```javascript
const ACCESS_KEY = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000';
```
Before uploading your experimentto the UiL-OTS data server, you will need to change this to the access_key that you obtained when your experiment was approved. For elaborate info see `globals.js`.


### Adapting stimuli
- Open the file `stimuli.js` in your plain text editor.
- There is a list, called LIST_1:

```javacript
const LIST_1 = [ // stimuli and timeline variables

```
-  This list can be adapted to your own needs, i.e, you can replace values, make the list longer (don't forget to increment the 'id' values for new items!).
- If you need to implement a more complex design, you should read the `stimuli.js` file (and its comment sections) a little better. 
- For an example of a Latin square design, please have a look [here](https://github.com/UiL-OTS-labs/jspsych-spr-mw).
